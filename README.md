### 3. Luxury Car Dealership Sales Analysis
- **Tools**: Power Query and Power BI

- I built an interactive Power BI dashboard answering key business questions.

**Impact:** The analysis provided dealership with actionable insights to align inventory with demand, prioritize high-performing brands, and optimize trade-in strategies. By leveraging data-driven decisions, the dealership can reduce overstock risk, increase profitability from high-value resales, and boost customer satisfaction through targeted seasonal promotions.
